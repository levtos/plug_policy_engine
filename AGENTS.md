# Codex bootstrap: plug_policy_engine

This is a durable, short repository bridge. The detailed and versioned
governance lives only in
[Levtos/control/docs/](https://github.com/Levtos/control/tree/main/docs).

- Use CTX first when it is available.
- Read the complete GitHub Issue, all comments, labels, and Project fields.
- Read ADR 0002, the relevant control/docs pages, and this repository's
  matching specification before implementation.
- GitHub is the only active and historical source.
- Work under exactly one Issue agent, recorded as `agent:codex` or
  `agent:claude`. Technical completion is not Live.
- For UX work, also follow ADR 0001 and `Levtos/control#17`.
- Keep this file short; do not copy detailed governance rules into the
  repository. Preserve only genuinely repository-specific HACS, release, or
  runbook notes here when they are current and unique.

## Local Completion Contract

- For this repository, complete the technical chain with focused repository
  tests or proportionate technical checks → pull request → server-side merge
  → stable release/tag through the existing repository workflow when this
  repository publishes a release.
- Live installation, reload, restart, and Live/Live-Verified verification
  remain a separate user/Benni gate.
